# Plantify
App for monitoring and watering plants based on their humidity.
The humidity of the plant is measured with a device that is controlling Arduino UNO. The plan was that the sensor for the humidity which has connected to Arduino is measuring and based on the value it will be watering the plant. Arduino UNO will be sending the values to a database and then that data the App will pull from it and work and the user can monitor their plants and controlling the watering of it.
